# User Setup

:::caution
If you are using a Pi-Node image you need only reference this material. The guide builds the image you can download.
:::

## Create the ada user

Create a new user and add it to the sudo group.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo adduser ada; sudo adduser ada sudo
```

### Change password

You can change the users password at anytime with.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
passwd
```

:::caution
Careful where you use sudo. For example issuing 'sudo passwd' would change the root password. This seems to be a place where new users get confused.
:::

### Login as ada

Let's add our ssh public key to our new $USER ada's authorized\_keys file. Then we can log in as ada and delete the default 'ubuntu' user.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
# drop back into your local terminal
exit
```

Use ssh-copy-id to add your public key to ada users authorized\_keys file.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
ssh-copy-id -i <ed25519-keyname.pub> ada@<server-ip>
```

and ssh into the Pi as ada.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
ssh ada@<server-ip>
```

Test that ada is in the sudo group by updating your package lists and upgrading the system.

:::caution
If you get error about repos and time it is because the clock is not set. Install chrony now to fix, otherwise we will install and configure it later.
:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade -y
```

We can delete the default ubuntu user and it's home directory.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo deluser --remove-home ubuntu
```

## ssh

Edit OpenSSH's configuration file and make the following changes with Nano text editor.

:::info
Check out this [nano cheat sheet](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html) I just found!

All the \# commented out values in sshd\_config are the default values. Remove the pound sign and change the value to match below. They will be loaded the next time systemd restarts ssh.
:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

:::caution
Turn off password authentication.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

:::info
I am not a proponent of changing default ports when I don't have to. A strong key pair and fail2ban is enough for me. It is not too hard for an attacker to figure out what port ssh is listening on if they really want to.
