# Introduction

Now that everything is set up let's start creating the pool. Please read the [official documentation](https://github.com/gitmachtl/scripts) Martin of [ATADA](https://stakepool.at/) pool provides to get a better understanding of the scripts. His tutorial is much more detailed and covers a lot of options. Thank you Martin!

This tutorial on the other hand is for the basics. It contains everything necessary to get a stake pool running and some other fundamental operations. It should help to get a nice and easy workflow.

The transfer with the USB device is fully automated. It just needs to be mounted at the current working environment, 
which should also work automated.
If not, mount it with ```sudo mount ~/usb_transfer```. Make sure to unmount every time before removing ```sudo umount ~/usb_transfer```. 

:::info

This guide assumes, that you are always in `$HOME/pool_keys` when running a script on the offline machine and in `$HOME/pi-pool` on the core.

:::

# Prerequisites on the cold machine

Let's begin with a directory for your keys.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd
mkdir pool_keys
cd pool_keys
```

:::info

Also make sure the offline machine's time is correct, you'll have to do this everytime you use it!

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
timedatectl
timedatectl set-time xxxxx
```

# Create a stake pool

:::caution 

Basically everything is created offline. Make sure that you never expose your secret keys to an online environment and back them up, multiple times best case. The only keys you need on your core are: kes-xxx.skey, vrf.skey and node-xxx.opcert.

:::

## Workflow

![](/img/offline_workflow.jpg)

## Create and fund a wallet

First of all you'll need a wallet and with it a staking key. Create the keys and name the wallet accordingly.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
03a_genStakingPaymentAddr.sh wallet_name cli
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Now copy the addresses to your core to fund the new wallet. You'll need your fresh USB drive for that.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh attach wallet_name.payment.addr
01_workOffline.sh attach wallet_name.staking.addr
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Switch the USB drive from offline to online machine.
Extract the address files.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh extract
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Retrieve the address and send some funds to your new wallet. You'll need at least 502 ADA + tx fees + your pledge.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cat wallet_name.payment.addr
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Query the balance and wait until the new UTXO shows up.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_queryAddress.sh wallet_name.payment
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


When the funds arrived copy the UTXO data to your offline machine. 


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh add wallet_name.payment
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Generate a transaction to register the staking address. 
It will be submitted later on.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal" 
03b_regStakingAddrCert.sh wallet_name.staking 
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Create the pool's keys and certificates

Generate the keys for your core node.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
04a_genNodeKeys.sh pool_name cli
04b_genVRFKeys.sh pool_name
04c_genKESKeys.sh pool_name
04d_genNodeOpCert.sh pool_name
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Generate your stakepool certificate and metadata.json.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default> 

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
05a_genStakepoolCert.sh pool_name
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


This creates a `pool_name.pool.json` file, which you can edit according to your needs and wishes. 
Everything is calculated in lovelaces. (Reminder: 1 ADA = 1,000,000 lovelace)
So in this case we get a pool with 100k ADA pledge, 340 ADA fixed cost (minimum) and 1% margin.

Add as many of your relays as you want. Either ip or dns based.

Pool description can contain up to 255 characters. 

poolMetaUrl points to the Metadata file, which you need to upload later. Github is a popular choice, if you don't want to use your own server.  

:::info

poolMetaUrl can only be 64 characters long.
Make sure it points to the raw file.
In case you need to shorten the URL you can do it by creating an empty `pool_name.metadata.json`, upload it
and shorten the URL. Make sure the short URL doesn't expire. Later replace it with the actual file. 

:::

You may also add an URL to an `extended.metadata.json`, which holds more information like the URL to your logo etc.
Just create the file on your local machine, it's quite self-explanatory. 
The png icon is limited to 64x64 while the logo could use 400x400 pixels. jpg works aswell.


<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="pool_name.pool.json" label="pool_name.pool.json" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
{
   "poolName": "pool_name",  
   "poolOwner": [
      {
      "ownerName": "wallet_name",
      "ownerWitness": "local"
      }
   ],
   "poolRewards": "wallet_name",
   "poolPledge": "100000000000",    
   "poolCost": "340000000",
   "poolMargin": "0.01"

      {
      "relayType": "dns",
      "relayEntry": "relay.mypool.com",
      "relayPort": "3001"
      }
      {
      "relayType": "ip",
      "relayEntry": "x.x.x.x (ipv4 of relay)",
      "relayPort": "3002"
      }
   ],
   "poolMetaName": "This is my Pool",
   "poolMetaDescription": "This is the description of my Pool!",
   "poolMetaTicker": "POOL",
   "poolMetaHomepage": "https://mypool.com",
   "poolMetaUrl": "https://mypool.com/pool_name.metadata.json",
   "poolExtendedMetaUrl": "",
   "---": "--- DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ---"
}
```
  </TabItem>  
  <TabItem value="extended.metadata.json" label="extended.metadata.json">

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
{
    "info": {
        "url_png_icon_64x64": "",
        "url_png_logo": "",
        "location": "",
        "social": {
            "twitter_handle": "",
            "telegram_handle": "",
            "facebook_handle": "",
            "youtube_handle": "",
            "twitch_handle": "",
            "discord_handle": "",
            "github_handle": ""
        },
        "company": {
            "name": "",
            "city": "",
            "country": ""
                    },
        "about": {
            "me": "",
            "server": "",
	    "company": ""
        },
    "my-pool-ids": {
        "0": ""
    },
    "when-satured-then-recommend": {
        "0": ""
    }
    }
   
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Now run ```05a_genStakepoolCert.sh pool_name``` again. This will generate the pool_name.pool.cert file and the actual pool_name.metadata.json.
Later you can upload the metadata.json to the URL you specified in the previous step. Do not edit it anymore or the hash won't fit!
If you want to change something, change it in the pool_name.pool.json and run ```05a_genStakepoolCert.sh pool_name``` again.

Delegate to your own pool as owner. (Pledge) 

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>  

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
05b_genDelegationCert.sh pool_name wallet_name
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Generate the stakepool registration transaction. The script also attaches the new pool_name.metadata.json to the offline transfer file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
05c_regStakepoolCert.sh pool_name wallet_name.payment
``` 
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now attach the files needed by the core.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.vrf.skey
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.kes-xxx.skey
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.node-xxx.opcert
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You are done with the offline part. Unmount and bring your USB drive to the core again.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh extract
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For convenience rename the core files so you don't have to change the startup script every KES rotation.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
mv pool_name.kes-xxx.skey kes.skey
mv pool_name.vrf.skey vrf.skey
mv pool_name.node-xxx.opcert node.cert
```
  </TabItem>  
</Tabs>

Now change the startup script and add the three files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano $HOME/.local/bin/cardano-service
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```
#!/bin/bash
. /home/ada/.adaenv

TOPOLOGY=${NODE_FILES}/${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json
DB_PATH=${NODE_HOME}/db
CONFIG=${NODE_FILES}/${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json
KES=${NODE_HOME}/kes.skey
VRF=${NODE_HOME}/vrf.skey
CERT=${NODE_HOME}/node.cert
cardano-node +RTS -N4 --disable-delayed-os-memory-return -RTS run \
  --topology ${TOPOLOGY} \
  --database-path ${DB_PATH} \
  --socket-path ${CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH} \
  --port ${NODE_PORT} \
  --config ${CONFIG} \
  --shelley-kes-key ${KES} \
  --shelley-vrf-key ${VRF} \
  --shelley-operational-certificate ${CERT}
```

Restart the service.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service restart
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

While your core is starting you can transfer the `pool_name.metadata.json` to your local machine and upload it to the prepared URL.
Do the same with the extended metadata and your logos, if you have made them.

Check the status of the core. When it's up again you can submit the transactions.
First the staking key registration, then repeat the same command for the stake pool registration.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh execute
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Confirm successful registration

### pool.vet

pool.vet is a website for pool operators to check the validity of their stake pools on chain data. You can check this site [Pool.vet](https://pool.vet/) for problems and clues as to how to fix them.



### adapools.org

You should create an account and claim your pool here at [adapools.org.](https://adapools.org/)


### pooltool.io

You should also create an account and claim your pool here on [pooltool.io](https://pooltool.io).


# Rotate KES keys

:::caution

Make sure to rotate your KES keys and node certificate before! they expire.

:::

:::info

Before starting check `timedatectl` on your offline machine and adjust, if needed.

:::

Create the new KES keypair. You will notice that the counter increments automatically.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
04c_genKESKeys.sh pool_name
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create a new operational certificate.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
04d_genNodeOpCert.sh pool_name
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now attach the new files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.vrf.skey
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.kes-xxx.skey
01_workOffline.sh attach pool_name.node-xxx.opcert
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Unmount and bring the USB drive to the core.
Stop the node and extract the files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service stop
01_workOffline.sh extract
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now rename/move them to match the startup script. 
Then start again. That's it.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
mv pool_name.kes-xxx.skey kes.skey
mv pool_name.vrf.skey vrf.skey
mv pool_name.node-xxx.opcert node.cert
cardano-service start 
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Update pool registration

First get up-to-date information from the core via your USB drive.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh add wallet_name.payment
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Switch to the offline machine and edit the values you want to change in the `pool_name.pool.json`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
chmod 600 pool_name.pool.json
nano pool_name.pool.json
chmod 400 pool_name.pool.json
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create a new certificate `pool_name.pool.cert` and `pool_name.metadata.json`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
05a_genStakepoolCert.sh pool_name
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create the registration transaction. If the metadata didn't change you don't need to attach it to the transfer file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
05c_regStakepoolCert.sh pool_name wallet_name.payment
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now switch to the core.
First, if you changed the metadata, ```01_workOffline.sh extract``` and upload it.
Otherwise skip this step and submit the transaction directly. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh execute
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Claim rewards

First get up-to-date information from the core via your USB drive.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh add wallet_name.payment
01_workOffline.sh add wallet_name.staking
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Switch over to the offline machine.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_claimRewards.sh wallet_name.staking wallet_name.payment
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Back to the core.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh execute
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

# Send a simple transaction

First get up-to-date information from the core via your USB drive.
Create a `other_wallet.payment.addr` which contains the address (and only the address) you want to send your ADA to.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh add wallet_name.payment
01_workOffline.sh attach other_wallet.payment.addr
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Bring everything over to the cold machine and create the transaction.
This will send 1000 ADA from your pledge wallet to the other wallet.
(Again everything in lovelaces. 1 ADA = 1000000 lovelace)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="offline" label="offline" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh extract
01_sendLovelaces.sh wallet_name.payment other_wallet.payment 1000000000
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution 

Make sure to meet your pledge at any time. And some ADA for transactions fees on top aren't bad.

:::

USB transfer and submitting at your core.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="core" label="core" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
01_workOffline.sh execute
```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>
