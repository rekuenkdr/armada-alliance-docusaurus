# Cardano Node Docker Image for ARM64 devices 🐳

In this project you will find the files to build a docker image on Linux containing all the needed files to run a Cardano full node.
The docker image can run on any arm64 device (such as a RaspberryPi, Mac Mini M1, etc.). The node can be configured as a relay or block production node.

## Why using docker image to run a Cardano node?

The advantage of deploying a Cardano node as a Docker image is, that it can be installed seamlessly and launched right out of the box. 
If you ever decide to remove it, you only have to delete one file - the image. Another advantage is that the created image can run on any 
operating system where Docker is installed. Using our Docker image reduces the complexity and effort of setting up a Cardano node compared to the traditional way 
(for example, you don't have to deal with systemd settings).

## System requirements

* CPU: ARM64 processor min 2 cores at 2GHz or faster.
* Memory: 16GB of RAM.
* Storage: 50 GB.
* OS: Linux (recommended Ubuntu)
* Additional Software: Docker
* Broadband: 10 Mbps +

:::tip

If you intend to use a Raspberry Pi 8GB RAM for the deployment of this docker image, please follow our [Server Setup guide](https://armada-alliance.com/docs/stake-pool-guides/pi-pool-tutorial/pi-node-full-guide/server-setup) first. 
This guide describes how to optimize the Hardware to satisfy the above listed system requirements. 

:::

# 1.Install Docker

The installation of Docker varies from operating system to operating system. For this reason, we share some helpful and good installation 
guide links for the different operating systems.

* [Install Docker on Linux (Ubuntu)](https://github.com/speedwing/cardano-staking-pool-edu/blob/master/DOCKER.md)
* [Install Docker on MacOs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
* [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

# 2. Set-up the Environment & Download Files

Create the repositories on your host system first. They will hold the files to build the docker image as well as the Cardano node configuration files.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}
sudo mkdir Cardano-node-docker
cd Cardano-node-docker
sudo mkdir -p node/db && sudo mkdir -p node/files && sudo mkdir -p dockerfiles/files
```  

The files to build the docker images will be downloaded from [MINI1 pool GitHub](https://github.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker)

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd dockerfiles
sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker/master/dockerfiles/armada-cn-arm64.dockerfile
sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker/master/dockerfiles/build.sh
sudo chmod +x build.sh
cd files
sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker/master/dockerfiles/files/run.sh
sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker/master/dockerfiles/files/tx-submit-service
sudo chmod +x run.sh
sudo chmod +x tx-submit-service
cd ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/node
sudo wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jterrier84/Cardano-node-docker/master/node/run-node.sh
sudo chmod +x run-node.sh
```

Download the latest official Cardano node configuration files from the IOHK repository and store them on our host system.

:::tip

For the sake of this tutorial we will download and set up the configuration files for the Cardano testnet. If you need the files for the mainnet
just replace "testnet" with "mainnet" here below.

:::

:::tip

As the configuration files might require modifications over time, it is way more practical to have them stored on the host, 
rather than have them stored inside the Docker container. Our Cardano Docker node will have access to these files from the container. 

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/node/files
export NODE_CONFIG="testnet"
export NODE_BUILD_NUM=$(curl https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/iohk-nix/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/index.html | grep -e "build" | sed 's/.*build\/\([0-9]*\)\/download.*/\1/g') 
sudo wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json
sudo wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-byron-genesis.json
sudo wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-shelley-genesis.json
sudo wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-alonzo-genesis.json
sudo wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json
sudo wget -O tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/master/cardano-submit-api/config/tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml
```

:::tip

- The directory /files contains the Cardano node configuration files.

- The directory /db will host the Cardano blockchain once the Docker node is started. It is important that the blockchain data 
are stored on the host system and not inside the Docker container, otherwise the entire blockchain would be deleted every time 
the Docker container is removed.

# 3. The Armada Node Docker Image

Now it's time to create the docker image. There are two ways to do this. 

1) Pull the pre-built docker image from our Armada Docker Hub repository (easiest and fastest option) (go to chapter 3.1)

2) Build the docker image by yourself (go to chapter 3.2) 

Either way, the docker image includes:

1. cardano-node & cardano-cli (latest version) - Cardano binaries to run the node (Download compiled binaries from [Armada Alliance GitHub](https://github.com/armada-alliance/cardano-node-binaries)) 
2. gLiveView - Monitoring tool for the Cardano node
3. ScheduledBlocks - Tool to query the scheduled slots for a block production node. (Credits for this tool goes to [SNAKE POOL](https://github.com/asnakep/ScheduledBlocks))
4. Cardano Submit Transaction API - API to connect with a Cardano wallet (e.g. Nami) to send transactions via your own full node

## 3.1. Pull the built docker image

Pull the image with:

```bash
docker pull armadaalliance/armada-cn:1.35.7
```

You should see your Cardano node docker image in the list:

```bash
docker images
```

```bash
REPOSITORY              TAG            IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
armadaalliance/armada-cn        1.35.7         da4414775ce6   37 seconds ago   700MB
```

You can now proceed with chapter 4, in order to start the node.

## 3.2. Build the docker image

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/dockerfiles
sudo ./build.sh
```
The process might take some minutes.

Once the process is done, you can use the command to see the list of all Docker images on your host system:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker images
```

You should see your Cardano node docker image in the list, e.g.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
REPOSITORY              TAG            IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
armadaalliance/armada-cn        1.35.7         da4414775ce6   37 seconds ago   700MB
<none>                  <none>         f3891eef21e4   3 minutes ago    1.09GB
```

All we need is the "armada/armada-cn" image. You can delete the others in the list to free up space on your harddrive, e.g.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker rmi f3891eef21e4 
```

# 4. Start node

Let's first configure the run-node.sh script to match your host system environment.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/node
sudo nano run-node.sh
```

Edit the configuration section according to your setup.

:::tip

If you are running the node as relay node, you can ignore the paramter CN_KEY_PATH.

:::

:::caution

Important: Change the directory paths CN_CONFIG_PATH and CN_DB_PATH to the corresponding locations on your host. 

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
##Configuration for relay and block producing node
CNIMAGENAME="armada/armada-cn"                                   ## Name of the Cardano docker image

CN_RTS_OPTS="+RTS -N2 -I0.1 -Iw3600 -A64m -AL128M -n4m -F1.1 -H3500M -O3500M -RTS"      ## RTS optimization parameters
CN_BF_ID=""                                                      ## Your blockfrost.io project ID (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_POOL_ID=""                                                    ## Your stake pool ID (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_POOL_TICKER=""                                                ## Your pool ticker (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_VRF_SKEY_PATH=""                                              ## Name of the vrf.skey file. It must be located in the same directory as CN_KEY_PATH (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_KEY_PATH=""                                                   ## Path to the folder where the OP certificate and keys are stored on the host system (for block production node only)
```

After making the changes, save and close the file.

`Ctrl+o & ENTER & Ctrl+x`

You can now run the docker image.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo ./run-node.sh
```

## Check the running status of the docker container

You can check the running status of the docker container at any time with:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker ps -a
```

If the docker node started successfully, you might see something like this:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                                                                      NAMES
fed0cfbf7d86   armadaalliance/armada-cn:1.35.7   "bash title=">_ Terminal" -c /home/carda…"   12 seconds ago   Up 10 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:3001->3001/tcp, :::3001->3001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:12799->12798/tcp, :::12799->12798/tcp   cardano-node-testnet-1.34.1
```

You can also check the logs of the running cardano-node:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker logs -f {CONTAINER ID}
``` 

To exit the logs press `Ctrl+c`

## Stop/Restart/Delete the Docker Cardano node

To stop the running Cardano node execute:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker stop {CONTAINER ID}
```

A stopped container can be started again with:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker start {CONTAINER ID}
```

A stopped container can also be deleted. Once deleted, it can not be started with the command above again.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker rm {CONTAINER ID}
```

If you like to start the node again, after having removed the docker container, just run the run-node.sh script.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/node/run-node.sh
```

## Monitor the Docker Cardano node with gLiveView

While the docker Cardano node is running, you can monitor its status with the tool gLiveView.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker exec -it {CONTAINER ID} /home/cardano/pi-pool/scripts/gLiveView.sh
```

## Check the scheduled slots of the block production node

Our Docker image contains the ScheduledBlocks python script from [SNAKE pool](https://github.com/asnakep/ScheduledBlocks). This tool allows to
query the blockchain for the scheduled slots for your block production node.

Before using the script, make sure that the right configurations are set in our shell script run-node.sh. Set the following variables:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
CN_BF_ID="mainnetd9PBzlK7KB7wWko8NTKUwJIsHfvEKNaV"               ## Your blockfrost.io project ID (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_POOL_ID="c3e7025ebae638e994c149e5703e82619b31897c9e1d64fc684f81c2"   ## Your stake pool ID (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_POOL_TICKER="MINI1"                                           ## Your pool ticker (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_VRF_SKEY_PATH="scheduledblocks.vrf.skey"                      ## Name of the vrf.skey file. It must be located in the same directory as CN_KEY_PATH (for ScheduledBlock script)
CN_KEY_PATH="/home/julienterrier/Cardano-node-docker/node/files/.keys"  ## Path to the folder where the OP certificate and keys are stored on the host system
```

Start the ScheduledBlocks.py script and follow the instructions on the terminal:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
docker exec -it {CONTAINER ID} python3 /home/cardano/pi-pool/scripts/ScheduledBlocks/ScheduledBlocks.py
```
# Run node in P2P (peer-to-peer) mode

:::caution

# Run node in P2P (peer-to-peer) mode

:::caution

Although P2P can be enabled on Node version 1.35.0, IOHK does not yet recommend using it because it has not yet been officially released.

:::

In order for a node to connect to other peers in the network, a mechanism must be set in place. On Cardano the actual official mechanism
forsees the use of a static network topology file, where the IP adress and port number of known peers can be configured. To automate this process, a tool
called [TopologyUpdater](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/blob/alpha/docs/Scripts/topologyupdater.md) exists. IOHK is working on a more decentralized mechanism, called [peer-to-peer networking.](https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/cardano-network/p2p-networking)
The P2P networking doesn't require the configuration of a static network topology file anymore. 

To configure P2P on a relay node, we need to make some changes in the *-topology.json and *-config.json files:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}/Cardano-node-docker/node/files
sed -i 's+"TurnOnLogging": true,+"TurnOnLogging": true,\n  "TestEnableDevelopmentNetworkProtocols": true,\n  "EnableP2P": true,\n  "MaxConcurrencyBulkSync": 2,\n  "MaxConcurrencyDeadline": 4,\n  "TargetNumberOfRootPeers": 50,\n  "TargetNumberOfKnownPeers": 50,\n  "TargetNumberOfEstablishedPeers": 25,\n  "TargetNumberOfActivePeers": 10,+' *-config.json
```
 
Open the *-topology.json file with the nano editor and replace the entire content with:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano testnet-topology.json  ##use mainnet-topology.json for mainnet
```

Don't forget to enter the IP and Port of your block production node in the respective lines below:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
{
  "LocalRoots": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "localRoots": {
          "accessPoints": [
            {
              "address": "[IP block Production node]",
              "port": [Port block production node]
            }
          ],
          "advertise": false
        },
        "valency": 1
      }
    ]
  },
  "PublicRoots": [
    {
      "publicRoots" : {
        "accessPoints": [
          {
            "address": "relays-new.cardano-mainnet.iohk.io",
            "port": 3001
          }
        ],
        "advertise": true
      },
      "valency": 1
    }
  ],
  "useLedgerAfterSlot": 0
} 
``` 

To configure P2P on the block production node, the steps are the same as above, only the content of the *-topology.json is different:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
{
  "LocalRoots": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "localRoots": {
          "accessPoints": [
            {
              "address": "[IP Relay 1]",
              "port": [Port Relay 1]
            },
            {
              "address": "[IP Relay 2]",
              "port": [Port Relay 2]
            }
          ],
          "advertise": false
        },
        "valency": 2
      }
    ]
  },
  "PublicRoots": []
}
```

Your nodes are now ready to run in P2P mode.
