# Environment Setup

## Choose testnet or mainnet.

:::danger

There is a 500 ₳ Registration deposit and another 5 ₳ in registration costs to start a pool on mainnet. First time users are strongly recommended to use testnet. You can get tada (test ada) from the testnet faucet. [Testnet ADA faucet link](https://testnets.cardano.org/cardano-testnet/tools/faucet)

:::

Create the directories for our project.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.local/bin
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/files
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/scripts
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/logs
mkdir ${HOME}/git
mkdir ${HOME}/tmp
```

Create an .adaenv file, choose which network you want to be on and source the file. This file will hold the variables/settings for operating a Pi-Node. /home/ada/.adaenv

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
echo -e NODE_CONFIG=mainnet >> ${HOME}/.adaenv; source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

### Create bash variables & add \~/.local/bin to our $PATH 🏃

:::info Environment Variables in Linux/Unix

[Environment Variables in Linux/Unix](https://askubuntu.com/questions/247738/why-is-etc-profile-not-invoked-for-non-login-shells/247769#247769).

:::

:::caution
You must reload environment files after updating them. Same goes for cardano-node, changes to the topology or config files require a cardano-service restart.
:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
echo . ~/.adaenv >> ${HOME}/.bashrc
cd .local/bin; echo "export PATH=\"$PWD:\$PATH\"" >> $HOME/.adaenv
echo export NODE_HOME=${HOME}/pi-pool >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export NODE_PORT=3003 >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export NODE_FILES=${HOME}/pi-pool/files >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export TOPOLOGY='${NODE_FILES}'/'${NODE_CONFIG}'-topology.json >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export DB_PATH='${NODE_HOME}'/db >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export CONFIG='${NODE_FILES}'/'${NODE_CONFIG}'-config.json >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
#echo export NODE_BUILD_NUM=$(curl https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/iohk-nix/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/index.html | grep -e "build" | sed 's/.*build\/\([0-9]*\)\/download.*/\1/g') >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH="${HOME}/pi-pool/db/socket" >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
source ${HOME}/.bashrc; source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

## Build Libsodium

This is IOHK's fork of Libsodium. It is needed for the dynamic build binary of cardano-node.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd; cd git/
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
cd libsodium
git checkout 66f017f1
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Echo library paths into .bashrc file and source it.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

Update link cache for shared libraries and confirm.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo ldconfig; ldconfig -p | grep libsodium
```

## Build secp256k1

```
cd; cd git/
git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git
cd secp256k1
git reset --hard $SECP256K1_REF
./autogen.sh
./configure  --enable-module-schnorrsig --enable-experimental
make
sudo make install
```

Update link cache for shared libraries and confirm.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo ldconfig; ldconfig -p | grep secp256k1
```

## Build a static binary of jq

:::tip
It's handy to have a statically linked aarch64 jq binary that you can move to an ARM cold machine.

A Raspberry Pi 400 makes a great cold machine for signing pool transactions or rotating KES. This allows you to have a truly never online cold machine, and it's fairly portable and compact.
:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd $HOME/git
git clone https://github.com/stedolan/jq.git
cd jq/
git submodule update --init
autoreconf -fi
./configure --with-oniguruma=builtin
make LDFLAGS=-all-static
make check
sudo make install
```

Confirm.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
jq -V
# jq-1.6-145-ga9f97e9-dirty
which jq
# /usr/local/bin/jq
```

## Install CNVM (optional)

Optionally you can install `cnvm`, which will help you to automate some steps of the install process.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
bash <(curl -Ls https://github.com/HofmannZ/cnvm/raw/master/scripts/install.sh)
```

### Retrieve node files

<Tabs groupId="RETRIEVE_NODE_FILES">
  <TabItem value="cnvm" label="The cnvm command" default>

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cnvm download-config-files --topology
```

This command also modifies ${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json and update TraceBlockFetchDecisions to "true" & listen on all interfaces with Prometheus Node Exporter.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="The manual commands">

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd $NODE_FILES
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-byron-genesis.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-shelley-genesis.json

wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/master/cardano-submit-api/config/tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml
```

Run the following to modify ${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json and update TraceBlockFetchDecisions to "true" & listen on all interfaces with Prometheus Node Exporter.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sed -i ${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json \
    -e "s/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": false/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": true/g" \
    -e "s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g"
```

:::caution

If binaries already exist (if updating) you will have to confirm overwriting the old ones.

:::

Confirm binaries are in $USER's $PATH & desired version.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-node version
cardano-cli version
```

### Systemd unit startup scripts

Create the systemd unit file and startup script so systemd can manage cardano-node.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-service
```

Paste the following, save & exit.

```bash title="${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-service"
#!/bin/bash
. /home/ada/.adaenv

## +RTS -N4 -RTS = Multicore(4)
cardano-node run +RTS -N4 -RTS \
  --topology ${TOPOLOGY} \
  --database-path ${DB_PATH} \
  --socket-path ${CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH} \
  --port ${NODE_PORT} \
  --config ${CONFIG}
```

Allow execution of our new cardano-node service file.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
chmod +x ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-service
```

Open /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service
```

Paste the following, You will need to edit the username here if you chose to not use ada. Save & exit.

```bash title="/etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service"
# The Cardano Node Service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service

```

Create the systemd unit file and startup script so systemd can manage cardano-submit-api.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service
```

```bash title="${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service"
#!/bin/bash
. /home/ada/.adaenv

  --socket-path ${CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH} \
  --port 8090 \
  --config /home/ada/pi-pool/files/tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml \
  --listen-address 0.0.0.0 \
  --mainnet
```

Allow execution of our new cardano-submit-api service script.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
chmod +x ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service
```

Create /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service
```

Paste the following, You will need to edit the username here if you chose to not use ada. save & exit.

```bash title="/etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service"
# The Cardano Submit Service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service

[Unit]
Description     = Cardano submit service

TimeoutStopSec=10
LimitNOFILE=32768
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
EnvironmentFile=-/home/ada/.adaenv

[Install]
WantedBy= multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd so it picks up our new service files.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Let's add a couple functions to the bottom of our .adaenv file to make life a little easier.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

```bash title="${HOME}/.adaenv"
cardano-service() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" cardano-node.service
}

cardano-submit() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" cardano-submit.service
}
```

Save & exit.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

What we just did there was add a couple functions to control our cardano-service and cardano-submit without having to type out

> sudo systemctl enable cardano-node.service
>
> sudo systemctl start cardano-node.service
>
> sudo systemctl stop cardano-node.service
>
> sudo systemctl status cardano-node.service

Now we just have to:

- cardano-service enable (enables cardano-node.service auto start at boot)
- cardano-service start (starts cardano-node.service)
- cardano-service stop (stops cardano-node.service)
- cardano-service status (shows the status of cardano-node.service)

Or

- cardano-submit enable (enables cardano-submit.service auto start at boot)
- cardano-submit start (starts cardano-submit.service)
- cardano-submit stop (stops cardano-submit.service)
- cardano-submit status (shows the status of cardano-submit.service)

The submit service listens on port 8090. You can connect your Nami wallet like below to submit tx's yourself in Nami's settings.

```bash
http://<node lan ip>:8090/api/submit/tx
```

## ⛓ Syncing the chain ⛓

Manually syncing the chain with Raspberry Pi takes forever(days) and the chain is constantly growing about 80gb as of this update to the docs. We host snapshots that you can download that will greatly reduce time to synced node.

### Download snapshot

This service is provided as is. It is up to you. If you want to sync the chain on your own simply:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service enable
cardano-service start
cardano-service status
```

Otherwise download the latest snapshot:

<Tabs groupId="RETRIEVE_NODE_FILES">
  <TabItem value="cnvm" label="The cnvm command" default>

Be sure your node is **not** running.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service stop
```

Then run:

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cnvm download-snapshot
```

Once done, enable & start cardano-node.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service enable
cardano-service start
cardano-service status
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="The manual commands">

Be sure your node is **not** running & delete the db folder if it exists and download db/.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service stop
cd $NODE_HOME
rm -r db/
```

You can get a good snapshot for mainnet here.

https://csnapshots.io/

Once wget completes enable & start cardano-node.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-service enable
cardano-service start
cardano-service status
```

  </TabItem>

## gLiveView.sh

Guild operators scripts has a couple useful tools for operating a pool. We do not want the project as a whole, though there are a couple scripts we are going to use.

:::tip CNODE HELPER SCRIPTS

[https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/tree/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts](https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/tree/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts)

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd $NODE_HOME/scripts
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh
```

:::info

You can change the port cardano-node runs on in the .adaenv file in your home directory. Open the file edit the port number. Load the change into your shell & restart the cardano-node service.

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano /home/ada/.adaenv
source /home/ada/.adaenv
cardano-service restart
```

Add a line sourcing our .adaenv file to the top of the env file and adjust some paths.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sed -i env \
    -e "/#CNODEBIN/i. ${HOME}/.adaenv" \
    -e "s/\#CNODE_HOME=\"\/opt\/cardano\/cnode\"/CNODE_HOME=\"\${HOME}\/pi-pool\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#CNODE_PORT=6000"/CNODE_PORT=\"'${NODE_PORT}'\""/g" \
    -e "s/\#CONFIG=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/files\/config.json\"/CONFIG=\"\${NODE_FILES}\/"'${NODE_CONFIG}'"-config.json\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#TOPOLOGY=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/files\/topology.json\"/TOPOLOGY=\"\${NODE_FILES}\/"'${NODE_CONFIG}'"-topology.json\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#LOG_DIR=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/logs\"/LOG_DIR=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/logs\"/g"
```

Allow execution of gLiveView.sh.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
chmod +x gLiveView.sh
```

## topologyUpdater.sh

Until peer to peer is enabled on the network operators need a way to get a list of relays/peers to connect to. The topology updater service runs in the background with cron. Every hour the script will run and tell the service you are a relay and want to be a part of the network. It will add your relay to it's directory after four hours you should see in connections in gLiveView.

:::info
The list generated will show you the distance & a clue as to where the relay is located.
:::

Download the topologyUpdater script and have a look at it. Lower the number of peers to 10 and add any custom peers you wish. These are outgoing connections. You will not see any incoming transactions untill other nodes start connecting to you.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/topologyUpdater.sh
```

Lower the number of MX_PEERS to 10.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano topologyUpdater.sh
```

Save, exit and make it executable.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
chmod +x topologyUpdater.sh
```

:::caution
You will not be able to successfully execute ./topologyUpdater.sh until you are fully synced up to the tip of the chain.
:::

Create a cron job that will run the script every hour.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
crontab -e
```

:::info
Choose nano when prompted for editor.
:::

Add the following to the bottom, save & exit.

:::info
The Pi-Node image has this cron entry disabled by default. You can enable it by removing the #.
:::

```bash title="crontab"
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/home/ada/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
33 * * * * . $HOME/.adaenv; $HOME/pi-pool/scripts/topologyUpdater.sh
```

After four hours you can open ${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json and inspect the list of out peers the service suggested for you. Remove anything more than 7k distance(or less). IOHK recently suggested 8 out peers. The more out peers the more system resources it uses. You can also add any peers you wish to connect to manualy inside the script. This is where you would add your block producer or any friends nodes.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
nano $NODE_FILES/${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json
```

:::info

You can use gLiveView.sh to view ping times in relation to the peers in your {NODE_CONFIG}-topology file. Use Ping to resolve hostnames to IP's.

:::

Changes to this file will take affect upon restarting the cardano-service.

:::caution

Don't forget to remove the last comma in your topology file!

:::

Status should show as enabled & running.

Once your node syncs past epoch 208(shelley era) you can use gLiveView.sh to monitor your sync progress.

:::danger

It can take over an hour for cardano-node to sync to the tip of the chain. Use ./gliveView.sh, htop and log outputs to view process. Be patient it will come up.

:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd $NODE_HOME/scripts
./gLiveView.sh
```

## Prometheus, Node Exporter & Grafana

Prometheus connects to cardano-nodes backend and serves metrics over http. Grafana in turn can use that data to display graphs and create alerts. Our Grafana dashboard will be made up of data from our Ubuntu system & cardano-node. Grafana can display data from other sources as well, like [adapools.org](https://adapools.org).

:::info

You can connect a [Telegram bot](https://docs.armada-alliance.com/learn/stake-pool-guides/grafana-alerts-with-telegram) to Grafana which can alert you of problems with the server. Much easier than trying to configure email alerts.

:::

:::tip PROMETHEUS REPOSITORY

:::

![](/img/pi-pool-grafana.png)

### Install Prometheus & Node Exporter.

:::info
Prometheus can scrape the http endpoints of other servers running node exporter. Meaning Grafana and Prometheus does not have to be installed on your core and relays. Only the package prometheus-node-exporter is required if you would like to build a central Grafana dashboard for the pool, freeing up resources and having a single dashboard to monitor everything.
:::

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt install prometheus prometheus-node-exporter -y
```

Disable them in systemd for now.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl disable prometheus.service
sudo systemctl disable prometheus-node-exporter.service
```

### Configure Prometheus

Open prometheus.yml.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Replace the contents of the file with.

:::caution

Indentation must be correct YAML format or Prometheus will fail to start.

:::

          type: "node"
```

Save & exit.

Start Prometheus.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl start prometheus.service
```

### Install Grafana

:::tip GRAFANA REPOSITORY

[https://github.com/grafana/grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

:::

Add Grafana's gpg key to Ubuntu.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo su
wget -O- https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/grafana-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add latest stable repo to apt sources.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
echo "deb [arch=arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grafana-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

Update your package lists & install Grafana.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo apt update; sudo apt install grafana
```

Change the port Grafana listens on so it does not clash with cardano-node.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo sed -i /etc/grafana/grafana.ini \
         -e "s#;http_port#http_port#" \
         -e "s#3000#5000#"
```

Start Grafana

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo systemctl start grafana-server.service
```

### Cardano-monitor bash function

Open .adaenv

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cd ${HOME}; nano .adaenv
```

Down at the bottom add.

```bash title=".adaenv"
cardano-monitor() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" prometheus.service
    sudo systemctl "$1" prometheus-node-exporter.service
    sudo systemctl "$1" grafana-server.service
}
```

Save, exit & source.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
source .adaenv
```

Here we tied all three services under one function. Enable Prometheus.service, prometheus-node-exporter.service & grafana-server.service to run on boot and start the services.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
cardano-monitor enable
cardano-monitor start
```

:::caution

At this point you may want to start cardano-service and get synced up before we continue to configure Grafana. Go to the syncing the chain section. Choose whether you want to wait 30 hours or download the latest chain snapshot. Return here once gLiveView.sh shows you are at the tip of the chain.

:::

## Grafana, Nginx proxy_pass & snakeoil

Let's put Grafana behind Nginx with self signed(snakeoil) certificate. The certificate was generated when we installed the ssl-cert package.

You will get a warning from your browser. This is because ca-certificates cannot follow a trust chain to a trusted (centralized) source. The connection is however encrypted and will protect your passwords flying around in plain text.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Replace contents of the file with below.

```bash title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
# Default server configuration

Check that Nginx is happy with our changes and restart it.

```bash title=">_ Terminal"
sudo nginx -t
## if ok, do
sudo service nginx restart
```

You can now visit your pi-nodes ip address without any port specification, the connection will be upgraded to SSL/TLS and you will get a scary message(not really scary at all). Continue through to your dashboard.

### Configure Grafana

On your local machine open your browser and enter your nodes private ip address.

Log in and set a new password. Default username and password is **admin:admin**.

#### Configure data source

In the left hand vertical menu go to **Configure** > **Datasources** and click to **Add data source**. Choose Prometheus. Enter [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) where it is grayed out, everything else can be left default. At the bottom save & test. You should get the green "Data source is working" if cardano-monitor has been started. If for some reason those services failed to start issue **cardano-service restart**.

#### Import dashboards

Save the dashboard json files to your local machine.
